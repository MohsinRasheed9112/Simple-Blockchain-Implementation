# Simple-Blockchain-Implementation #
This repository contains a simple blockchain implementation in Python. It's designed to demonstrate the foundational concepts of blockchain technology, including creating blocks, mining them with a proof-of-work system, handling transactions, and ensuring the integrity of the blockchain through validation mechanisms.

## Features ##
**Block Creation:** Define and create individual blocks that store transactions.
**Blockchain Integrity:** Link blocks securely using hashing to ensure tamper-evident records.
**Proof of Work:** Implement a simple proof-of-work algorithm to mine new blocks.
**Transaction Handling:** Create and process transactions within blocks.
**Blockchain Validation:** Validate the integrity of the blockchain to prevent tampering.
